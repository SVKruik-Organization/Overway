# SK Overway

Welcome to SK Overway, a centralized SSO authentication server for the SK Platform project. This API manages all authentication and authorization services that the other SK Platform products rely on. Want to integrate with SK Platform or any of it's sub-products? This is the place to start.

Because a simple `README.md` can only do so much, I have also made an documentation platform, [SK Docs](https://platform.stefankruik.com/documentation). If you are serious about using my products, I highly recommend reading the relevant articles. Don't have time for that? Don't hesitate to [reach out](https://url.skpvt.io/r/support). I am always open to have a chat and answer questions to your heart's content, unless I am debugging deployment ðŸ˜„.
